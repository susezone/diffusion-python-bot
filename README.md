# A Basic PyTorch Discord Bot

This project is used for a Python-based Discord bot that can generate images locally using PyTorch via the \`!generate\` command. By pinging it as a @mention and sending an embedded file, it will run img2img. It's rather basic, and really just a learning experience on interacting with PyTorch and Discord, to polish async development and Python skills.

## Features

- Generate images locally using PyTorch via the \`!generate\` command
- Generate images by pinging the bot as a @mention and sending an embedded file, it will run img2img
- Images are hosted by the imgur API, allowing for a 25MiB file size for images instead of the default 8M for Discord
- Configuration settings can be found in \`diffusion_discord_bot/config/config.json\`, which can be copied from \`...config/example.json\` from the same directory

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies using \`pip install -r requirements.txt\`
3. Copy the example configuration file \`config/example.json\` to \`diffusion_discord_bot/config/config.json\` and modify the settings as necessary. Be sure to acquire and fill in all of the API tokens, or it likely won't work.
4. Configure whether you'd like to use attention scaling to cut down on GPU memory use, at the cost of generation time. This is a very slow process, so, it might be worthwhile to limit the maximum resolution you're using, instead.
5. Configure the maximum resolution for each aspect ratio you'll be serving. This is a bot-specific configuration, so that you can have multiple systems on one Discord server all generating images at different levels of quality, suitable to the local hardware.
6. Run the bot using \`poetry run bot\`

## Commands

### \`!generate\`

Generates an image on the bot's hardware using PyTorch. Syntax: \`!generate <prompt>\`

Example: \`!generate "A beautiful sunset over the mountains"\`

### @mention + embedded file

Generates an image using img2img when the bot is pinged and an image is embedded in the message. It's not great. Any improvement to the Dreambooth functionality is welcome.

## Hosting

The bot can be hosted on a server with Python installed, such as AWS or Google Cloud Platform. It is recommended to use a process manager such as systemd or PM2 to manage the bot's processes.
